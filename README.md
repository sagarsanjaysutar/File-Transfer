Project Title: Advanced File Transfer Utility

Description:
Create a file transfer utility application that allows users to securely transfer files between two computers over a network using sockets and various protocols like RTSP/RTP. The application will make use of multithreading to handle concurrent file transfers efficiently. It will utilize file handling and file streams to read and write files on both the client and server sides. The project will also involve implementing checksums to ensure data integrity during transmission.

Key Features:
GUI: In chat GPT refer the GUI recommendation.
File Transfer: Implement functionality to transfer files between client and server
Network Protocols: Support for RTSP/RTP protocols for efficient data transfer.
Multithreading: Utilize multithreading to handle multiple file transfers simultaneously.
Checksums: Calculate checksums for files before and after transmission to ensure data integrity.
Error Handling: Handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages.
File Handling: Read and write files using file streams and manage file descriptors appropriately.
STL Containers: Utilize STL containers like vectors or maps for managing data structures efficiently.
Smart Pointers: Use smart pointers to manage dynamic memory allocation and prevent memory leaks.
Object-Oriented Design: Design the application with an object-oriented approach, encapsulating functionality into classes and leveraging inheritance and polymorphism where appropriate.
Timers: Implement timers for synchronous/asynchronous file transfers and for managing timeouts during network operations.
CMake: Use CMake as the build system for the project to ensure portability and easy compilation on different platforms.

This project will provide a comprehensive hands-on experience with various advanced concepts in C++ and network programming, while also allowing you to demonstrate your proficiency in handling file operations, multithreading, networking, and other topics mentioned.
